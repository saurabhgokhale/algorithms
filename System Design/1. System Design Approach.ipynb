    "# System Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ABCD of system design\n",
    "\n",
    "[A]sk Good Questions\n",
    "- Talk to interviewer to figure out which **Features** he/she cares about.\n",
    "  - Feature set needs to be specific / small\n",
    "  - We do deep into the feature set\n",
    "- How much the system should scale \n",
    "  - **Request per Second** - How many requests per seconds needs to be handled\n",
    "  - **Latency** - How much latency is ok for the system to respond\n",
    "  - **Storage** - How much data needs to be stored in the database\n",
    "  \n",
    "Dont use [B]uzzwords \n",
    "- Dont talk about topics that you have just heard of and does not have indepth knowledge of.\n",
    "\n",
    "[C]lear and Organized Thinking\n",
    "- Before jumping into minor details of the problems, first design 20 thousand view of the application.\n",
    "- Make sure we design all the APIs\n",
    "- Define Actors for the application\n",
    "\n",
    "[D]rive Discussion\n",
    "- 80-20 Rule: We speak 80% of the time, interviewer speaks 20% of the time, we drive the discussion and the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Features of System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features** - Define minimum viable products. Keeps some features in the design and exclude some features. Based on the type of system some of the features like security can be ignored / kept out of the design. But if the design is about Authentication then security is a central piece of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define APIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Availability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Latency / Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Durability** - To make sure data is secure and consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Diagram**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security and Privacy**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Effective solution**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts for the Design questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vertical vs Horizontal Scalability\n",
    "- CAP theorem\n",
    "- Partitioning / Sharding Data\n",
    "- Optimistic vs Pessimistic locking\n",
    "- Strong vs Eventual Consistency\n",
    "- Relational DB vs No SQL\n",
    "- Type of NO SQL\n",
    "  - Key / Value\n",
    "  - Wide column\n",
    "  - Document based\n",
    "  - Graph based\n",
    "- Caching\n",
    "- Data center / Racks / Hots\n",
    "- CPU / memory / HD / Network Bandwidth\n",
    "- Random vs Sequential read/write on disk\n",
    "- HTTP vs HTTP2 vs websockets\n",
    "- TCP / IP model\n",
    "- IPv4 vs IPv6\n",
    "- TCP vs UDP\n",
    "- DNS lookup\n",
    "- HTTPS & TLS\n",
    "- Public key / Private key - Symmetric vs Asymetric key encryption\n",
    "- LB - L4 vs L7\n",
    "- CDN & Edge\n",
    "- Bloom filters & Count min Sketch\n",
    "- Paxos - Consensus over distributed hosts\n",
    "  - Leader election\n",
    "- Design patterns and Object oriented design\n",
    "- Virtual machines & containers\n",
    "- Publish - Subscribe messaging or queue\n",
    "- Map Reduce\n",
    "- Multi threading, concurrency, locks, synchronization, CAS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actual Implementations of the above concepts\n",
    "- Cassandra\n",
    "  - Uses eventual / strong consistency. Uses algorithm to shard data. Gossiping to keep cluster of servers.\n",
    "- Mongodb / Couchbase\n",
    "  - ACID properties at document level\n",
    "- MySQL / Postgres\n",
    "  - Traditional ACID properties, secondary indexes\n",
    "- Memcache / Redis\n",
    "  - Fast key value storage\n",
    "  - can be stored as cluster\n",
    "  - Note: Distributed cache can never be the **source of truth** and then can only store **limited** amount of data, limited by amount of memory on the machine.\n",
    "- Zookeeper\n",
    "- Kafka\n",
    "  - fault tolerent queue\n",
    "- Nginx / HAProxy\n",
    "- Solr / Elastic Search\n",
    "- Blob store (like S3)\n",
    "- Docker\n",
    "  - Swarm\n",
    "  - Kubernates\n",
    "- Hadoop / Spark\n",
    "  - HDFS\n",
    "  - Avro\n",
